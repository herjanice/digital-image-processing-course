## Problem 1: Edge Detection
Goal: explore various image processing techniques such as Sobel edge detection, Canny edge detection, Laplacian of Gaussian edge detection, and edge crispening. It also involves comparing and analyzing the results obtained from these techniques, selecting optimal parameters, and applying the Hough transform for line detection.

**Task 1:** Apply Sobel edge detection

**Task 2:** Perform Canny edge detection

**Task 3:** Use Laplacian of Gaussian edge detection to generate edge map

**Task 4:** Perform edge crispening

**Bonus:** Apply the Hough transform

## Problem 2: Geometrical Modification
Goal: Design and implement an algorithm for image classification using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a pre-trained model as the starting point. The dataset consists of images of different categories, and the performance of the model will be evaluated on a test set using accuracy as the evaluation metric. The training process will include data augmentation, fine-tuning the pre-trained model, and hyperparameter tuning. The final trained model will be saved and used to classify new images.

**Task 1:** Improve the given sample3.png

**Task 2:** Design an algorithm to make sample3.png looks like sample4.png (hint: you may perform rotation, scaling, translation, etc.)

**Task 3:** Design an algorithm to make sample5.png looks like sample6.png as much as possible.
