# Digital Image Processing Course Repository 2022 Spring

This course provides an in-depth study of digital image processing techniques with a focus on low, middle, and high-level image processing. Low-level processing covers techniques such as noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and image sharpening. Middle-level processing focuses on segmentation and image description techniques. High-level processing includes techniques for recognizing objects in images.

The topics covered is as follows:
- Introduction and Digital Image Fundamentals
- Image Enhancement in Spatial Domain
- Edge Detection
- Geometrical Modification
- Morphological Processing
- Digital Halftoning and Inverse Halftoning
- Texture Analysis
- Document Processing
- Image Sampling and Transforms
- Image Enhancement in Frequency Domain
- Color Image Processing
- Image Compression
