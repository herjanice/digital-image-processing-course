## Problem 1: Morphological Processing
Goal: Please design an algorithm to improve the given image and output the result, then perform some morphological operations on the resulting image and output the corresponding results with detailed descriptions and parameter specifications.

**Task 1:** Design a morphological processing to extract object's boundaries

**Task 2:** Perform hole filling on sample1.png

**Task 3:** Apply skeletonizing, reverse foreground and background pixels and apply skeletonizing again to the resultant image.

**Task 4:** Perform connected component labeling to count number of objects. Label each objects with different colours.

## Problem 2: Texture Analysis
Goal: Implement various image processing techniques on given images and analyze the results.

**Task 1:** Apply edge detection algorithms and compare the results.

**Task 2:** Perform morphological operations to extract object boundaries, fill holes, and perform connected component labeling.

**Task 3:** Apply Law's method for feature extraction and use k-means algorithm for pixel classification.

**Task 4:** Improve the classification result and perform image quilting.

**Bonus:** Apply Hough transform for line detection.
