Results and findings of this homework could be found [here](https://github.com/herjanice/digital-image-processing-course/blob/main/hw4/HW_4_Report.pdf)

## Problem 1: Digital Halftoning
Goal: Perform various image processing task such as mage filtering, edge detection, morphological operations, feature extraction, segmentation, and color manipulation

**Task 1**: Perform dithering using I_{2}

**Task 2**: Expand the dither matrix I_{2} to I_{256} and perform dithering.

**Task 3**: Perform error diffusion with Floyd-Steinberg and Jarvis' patterns.

## Problem 2: Image Sampling
Goal: Perform image sampling and unsharp masking.

**Task 1**: Perform appropriate and inappropriate image sampling and analyze the effects on the resultant image.

**Task 2**: Perform unsharp masking on an image in the frequency domain and convert back to the pixel domain using inverse Fourier transform.
