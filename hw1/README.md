## Problem 0: Warm Up
Goal: getting familiar with fundamentail operations

**Task 1:** Perform horizontal flipping

**Task 2:** Transform color to grayscale image (built-in functions such as cv2.cvtColor() to directly perform transformation are NOT allowed.)

## Problem 1: Image Enhancement
Goal: To implement various image processing techniques such as brightness adjustment, histogram equalization, local histogram equalization, and transfer function design to enhance the given gray-level image. Additionally, to analyze the effects of these techniques by comparing the histograms and resultant images.

**Task 1:** Decrease the brightness by dividing intensity values by 2

**Task 2:** Increase the brightness by multiplying intensity values by 3

**Task 3:** Plot the histograms of previous result

**Task 4:** Perform global histogram equalization

**Task 5:** Perform local histogram equalization

**Task 6:** Design transfer function to enhance image (Try to obtain most appealing result by adjusting the parameters.

## Problem 2: Noise Removal
Goal: Design filters to remove noise from two given images, and output the denoised images. Compute the PSNR values of the denoised images and provide a discussion of the noise removal process, including the chosen filters and parameters.

**Task 1:** Design proper filters to remove noise on sample4.png and sample5.png.

**Task 2:** Compute PSNR values of the resulting image in Task 1.
